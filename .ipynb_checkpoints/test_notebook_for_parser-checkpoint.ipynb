Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\\nit ov\",\n",
       " 'er afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n\\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.\\n\\n  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,\\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\\nfalling down a very deep well.\\n\\n  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she\\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to\\nwonder what was ',\n",
       " \"going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\\nsee anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\\nhere and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was\\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\\nsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\\nfell past it.\\n\\n  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\\nshall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\\nall think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\\neven if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely\\ntrue.)\\n\\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I\\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.\\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\\n\",\n",
       " \"me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\\nyou see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\\nlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,\\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\\nor Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\\nor Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to\\nsay.)\\n\\n  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\\nTHROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the\\npeople that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I\\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\\nhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\\nPlease, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\\nt\",\n",
       " \"hrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what\\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\\nnever do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\\n\\n  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I\\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember\\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were\\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\\nyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\\nBut do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\\nrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\\nway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do\\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\\nquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she\\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very\\nearnestly, `\",\n",
       " \"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a\\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\\nsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\\n\\n  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\\nmoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\\nsight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\\naway went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\\nsay, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\\nit's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the\\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\\nhanging from the roof.\\n\\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\\nother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\\nwondering how she was ever to get out again.\\n\\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legg\",\n",
       " \"ed table, all made of\\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\\ndoors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\\nthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\\nthem.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\n\\n  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\\npassage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\\nshe could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\\nmy head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\\nvery little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\\nI could s\",\n",
       " 'hut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\\nknow how to begin.\\'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\\nhad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\\nthings indeed were really impossible.\\n\\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\\ntelescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\\ncertainly was not here before,\\' said Alice,) and round the neck\\nof the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME\\'\\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\\n\\n  It was all very well to say `Drink me,\\' but the wise little\\nAlice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I\\'ll look\\nfirst,\\' she said, `and see whether it\\'s marked \"poison\" or not\\';\\nfor she had read several nice little histories about children who\\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\\nthings, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rule',\n",
       " \"s\\ntheir friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\\nwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\\n`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\\nlater.\\n\\n  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\\nto taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\\nof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\\nturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\\nit off.\\n\\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n         *       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up\\nlike a telescope.'\\n\\n  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\\nher face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right\\nsize for going through the little door into that lovely garden\",\n",
       " \".\\nFirst, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\\ngoing to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\\nthis; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\\ngoing out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be\\nlike then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is\\nlike after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\\never having seen such a thing.\\n\\n  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\\non going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!\\nwhen she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the\\nlittle golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\\nshe found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it\\nquite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb\\nup one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying,\\nthe poor little thing sat down and cried.\\n\\n  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\\nherself, rather sharply; \",\n",
       " \"`I advise you to leave off this minute!'\\nShe generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\\nseldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\\nseverely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\\ntrying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\\nof croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\\nchild was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\\nuse now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!

Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of\\ngloves and a fan!  Quick, now!'

Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no\\nroom at all for any lesson-books!'\\n\\n  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,\\nand making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few\\nminutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\\n\\n  `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice.  `Fetch me my gloves\\nthis moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the\\nstairs.

This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more\\nsounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there\\nmust be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for\\npulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I\\ndon't want to stay in here any longer!'\\n\\n  She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at\\nlast came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a\\ngood many voices all talking together:  she made out the words:\\n`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;\\nBill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!-\",\n",

It was opened by another footman in livery,\\nwith a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,\\nAlice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their\\nheads.

An\\ninvitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog-Footman\\nrepeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the\\nwords a little, `From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess\\nto play croquet.'\\n\\n  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled\\ntogether.\\n\\n  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into\\nthe wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped\\nout the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the\\nground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\n\\n  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\n\\n  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and\\nthat for two reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the\\ndoor as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise\\ninside, no one could possibly hear you.\",\n",
       " \"'  And certainly there was\\na most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling\\nand sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish\\nor kettle had been broken to pieces.\\n\\n  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'\\n\\n  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went\\non without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For\\ninstance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let\\nyou out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time\\nhe was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But\\nperhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so\\nVERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might\\nanswer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.\\n\\n  `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'\\n\\n  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate\\ncame skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just\\ngrazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees\\nbehind him.\\n\\n  \",\n",
       " \"`--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,\\nexactly as if nothing had happened.\\n\\n  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\n\\n  `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.  `That's the\\nfirst question, you know.'\\n\\n  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.\\n`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the\\ncreatures argue.  It's enough to drive one crazy!'\\n\\n  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for\\nrepeating his remark, with variations.  `I shall sit here,' he\\nsaid, `on and off, for days and days.'\\n\\n  `But what am I to do?' said Alice.\\n\\n  `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.\\n\\n  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:\\n`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.\\n\\n  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of\\nsmoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a\\nthree-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was\\nleaning over t\",\n",

Even the\\nDuchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was\\nsneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The\\nonly things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,\\nand a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from\\near to ear.\\n\\n  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for\\nshe was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to\\nspeak first, `why your cat grins like that?'\\n\\n  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why.  Pig!'\\n\\n  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice\\nquite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed\\nto the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on\\nagain:--\\n\\n  `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I\\ndidn't know that c\",\n",

I--'\\n\\n  `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide\\nfigures!'

She said the last words out loud, and the little thing\\ngrunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't\\ngrunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing\\nyourself.'\\n\\n  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into\\nits face to see what was the matter with it.
